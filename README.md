With over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I have evolved from a hands-on engineer to a strategic leader in technology and innovation. As the CTO of [Pandas.io](https://pandas.io), I oversee engineering teams, driving initiatives that prioritize industry-leading user experiences and innovative, scalable solutions.

My role focuses on empowering teams, fostering a culture of collaboration, and steering the company’s technology strategy to align with our broader business goals. I am passionate about mentoring future leaders and building systems that support sustainable growth.

Throughout the past decade, I have led innovative projects across multiple industries. From steering bespoke solutions in the retail sector at Intale to playing a pivotal role in the EDND digitization project at Intrasoft International, my work has spanned enterprise software, cloud solutions, NFC communications, and software-defined radio.

I excel at leading teams and scaling technology infrastructures to transform ambitious ideas into impactful outcomes. I have had the honor of representing my work on the global stage, securing recognition at prestigious events such as ACM SIGMOD in San Francisco and the International Olympiad in Informatics in Thailand and Canada.

I am driven by the pursuit of growth and the excitement of new challenges, always looking for opportunities to create lasting value. Let’s collaborate and build something exceptional together!
